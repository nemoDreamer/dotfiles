nemoDreamer dotfiles
====================

Bash environment setup

---

## Installation

- Clone repo into directory of your choice (I recommend `~/Library/Scripts/.`)
- Run `./install.sh`

This will symlink dotfiles and all its contents into your `~`.

## Usage

- Typing `aliases` will open the aliases file containing your -- for lack of a better word -- aliases.
- `profile` is an alias to edit your symlinked `~/.profile -> ~/.dotfiles/profile`
- Read both these files for more goodies.

## Uninstallation

You can safely uninstall all dotfiles symlinks by running `~/.dotfiles/uninstall.sh`.
